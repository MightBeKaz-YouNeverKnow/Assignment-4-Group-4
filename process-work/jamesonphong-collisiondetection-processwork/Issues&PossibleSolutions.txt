-=- ISSUES PT.1 -=-

- Current Collision Detection code heavily relies on Vector2 position & velocity
- Current Player Movement code heavily relies on floats
- Breakpoint reveals that despite Player spawn positions are at different areas on the screen, their XY coords are still equal due to floats

-=- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS PT.1 -=-

- Rewrite Player Movement code to utilize Vector2 position & velocity instead
- After rewriting Player Movement, reattempt integrating Collision Detection code

-=- ISSUES PT.2 -=-

- Players when spawned in seem to vibrate and gravity isn't working correctly
- Players still do not collide with each other

-=- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS PT.2 -=-

- Re-reviewing modules on Vector2 and Collision
- Rewriting Collision Detection code to fit with intersecting circles instead
- Comparing distance between Players to Player Radius

-=- ISSUES PT.3 -=-

- Players still move through each other, however they now do land on top of each other, however they do slowly fall through each other

-=- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS PT.3 -=-

- Removed code to call Player Controls & Gravity function from Player Setup function and placed it inside of Collision Detection function instead

-=- ISSUES PT.4 -=-

- Players now get stuck on each other when colliding horizontally

-=- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS PT.4 -=-

- Added in code in the Collision Detection where once both Players velocities hit 0, their positions would also shift by 5 pixels.
